## Our problem:
We will test the default configurations of these methods on features that focus on the end of the time series variables as they are likely the most predictive of whether a room transition will occur or not.

## Exercise 1: Extend a simple neural network:
Followed the tutorial of:
https://stackabuse.com/introduction-to-neural-networks-with-scikit-learn/
In the 4evaulate_models script, I added the `MLPClassifier` as the simple Neural Network. After scaling, the accuracy score of this was `62.500%`.
